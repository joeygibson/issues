This is a command-line tool that started out as the code in [this blog post](https://blog.bartfokker.nl/issue-table/). 
I've modified it to use the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) option parser, and the [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
companion library to support other ways of passing in some options.
